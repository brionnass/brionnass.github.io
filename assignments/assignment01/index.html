    <h1>Butterflies Info</h1>

    <p>
        Butterflies are fascinating insects known for their vibrant colors and delicate wings. They undergo a complete metamorphosis, transforming from an egg to a caterpillar, then into a chrysalis, and finally emerging as an adult. These delicate creatures are essential pollinators, playing a crucial role in plant reproduction and supporting ecosystem health. Their life cycle symbolizes transformation and renewal in many cultures.

        In addition to their ecological importance, butterflies captivate people with their beauty. The patterns on their wings can serve as camouflage or warnings to predators. Species like the Monarch butterfly are famous for their long migrations, traveling thousands of miles to breed. As sensitive indicators of environmental health, butterflies are vital subjects in ecological studies and conservation efforts.
