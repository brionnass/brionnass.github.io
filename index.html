                <p>For this assignment, I created a website on a classroom-appropriate topic of my choice. The project required me to structure the HTML code correctly, starting with the Doctype declaration and including all necessary elements. I added a main heading (h1) and wrote two detailed paragraphs, each with at least four sentences, to provide content for the page. The website also features two images that are appropriately sized to fit the design. I included a bulleted list with at least three items, a table with two columns and three rows, and two external links to relevant resources. This assignment helped me understand the basics of HTML structure and how to organize content effectively on a webpage.</p>

                <p>In this assignment, I got hands-on with CSS to style a simple HTML page. I learned how to change the look and feel of a webpage by adjusting things like colors, fonts, and layout. I practiced using different CSS selectors to target specific elements, and I played around with margins, padding, and borders to better understand how the box model works. This assignment really helped me see how powerful CSS is for making a webpage look polished and visually appealing.</p>

                <p>In this assignment, the focus was on creating a single webpage that effectively utilizes CSS Flexbox for layout. The webpage was structured using essential HTML5 elements like header, footer, nav, section, aside, and article. A navigation bar was created, and the layout was designed to be responsive, adapting to both large and small screens. Flexbox was used to arrange content into columns, with media queries ensuring a smooth transition to vertical layouts on smaller devices. The assignment also emphasized making the page visually appealing with background colors, padding, and font styles. Images and placeholder text were included to complete the design, following the specified layout diagram.</p>
